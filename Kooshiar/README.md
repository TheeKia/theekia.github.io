Kooshiar - [Front-End Competition](https://github.com/kooshiar/competitions)

Build a Pinterest-style web page that displays information from the API endpoint.

# About My Code...

This project could be done in many ways (REACT, Next.Js), but since It's a small one, I choose HTML, CSS (SASS) and vanilla javascript.

Since opinions on user interface can vary and The design goals are unknown.
I focused mainly on **logic** and **adding more features**

## Website features

I used **No** libraries for this project to show my skills.

### Extra Score

- [x] **Infinite-scroll**
- [x] **Mobile responsive**: It's been designed to work on any device and browser.
- [x] **Client-side search**

### More features

- **Similar Products**: I've managed to detect the **type**, **color**, **material**, and **style** of the product as soon as it loads and then used the data to find similar ones to show when the user clicks on the product.
- **Save section**: Each product has a save button that can be then accessed from the **saved section** (On the top menu)
  - Although it's totally functional since there is no back-end to save the data, It will be deleted if you clear the browser data.
- **Dark Theme**: The theme default is _light_, but you can change it to _dark_ via the button on the header.
  - The theme preference is saved on the **local storage** (Like saved products).

## About Me

I'm Kia Abdi, Pharm.D. student at Tabriz University of Medical Science.

### Skills:

- **HTML**
- **CSS**: + SASS
- **JavaScript**
- **REACT**: + Next.Js
- **Python**
- **Git**

I'm also familiar with **PHP** but not a pro at it.

I'm a self-taught Full-Stack web developer. But I usually refer to myself as "Front-End" because I'm very comfortable with it.

Because it's not my main field of study I might not have the best resume but I'm **not** lacking in knowledge or skills. And I'm ready for any technical question or test.

## More information on design

I had some ideas about categorizing the saved products but I think the point of this challenge is to determine the skill level of the contestants. And doing so is required no new skill set. But I will do **whatever it takes** to join your team. so please let me know if I had to add more features or change the design.
